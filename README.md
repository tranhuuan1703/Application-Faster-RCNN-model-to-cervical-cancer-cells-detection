# Application Faster RCNN model to cervical cancer cells detection

## Overview.
Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, and leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for early detection plays a crucial role in combating this disease. The project, titled "Application of Faster RCNN Model for Cervical Cancer Cells Detection," aims to contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics by utilizing AI techniques. The dataset for this research has been sourced from the Kaggle website, providing a diverse and comprehensive set of images related to cervical cancer.<br>

The primary objective of this project is to employ AI to detect abnormalities in medical imaging, specifically focusing on the identification of cervical cancer cells. The chosen methodology involves the use of the Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model, known for its efficiency in object detection tasks. The model is designed to recognize and highlight abnormal cell structures within medical images captured through various imaging devices.<br>

It is essential to note that the project is currently ongoing and remains in the research phase. The Faster RCNN model is undergoing continuous refinement and updates as part of the research process. The commitment to ongoing research and improvement underscores the dedication to developing a robust and accurate tool for the early detection of cervical cancer, with the potential to significantly impact the field of medical diagnostics.<br>
## Description.
### The dataset.
The dataset under consideration has been meticulously curated from Kaggle, a renowned platform for hosting diverse and high-quality datasets. Comprising a total of 966 images, the dataset captures cellular clusters derived from Pap smear slides. These images have been acquired using a CCD camera meticulously calibrated with optical microscopy lenses. The cellular content within the images is categorized into five distinct types, encapsulating both normal and abnormal cell structures, as well as benign cells. This comprehensive classification provides a nuanced understanding of cellular morphology and aids in the development of models for the detection and analysis of abnormal cellular structures within Pap smear images. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners engaged in the advancement of medical image analysis and diagnostic technologies.<br>
